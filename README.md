# Create-RDS-Database-on-AWS-
Create a relational database using Amazon RDS and connect it to an EC2 instance for interaction only.
## About Project:

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to deploy a **managed relational database** in the cloud using **Amazon RDS**, and securely connect to it from an **Amazon Linux EC2 instance**. This setup reflects real-world backend infrastructure used in scalable web applications, enterprise systems, and civic tech platforms.

## Technologies Used:

- **Amazon RDS** â†’ Managed cloud database (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- **Amazon EC2** â†’ Linux-based virtual server for testing
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL Client** â†’ CLI tool to connect to RDS
- **AWS VPC** â†’ Isolated network environment for EC2 and RDS
- **Security Groups** â†’ Firewall rules to control access
- **SSH** â†’ Secure shell access to EC2
- **AWS Console** â†’ GUI interface for provisioning and monitoring

### ðŸ”¹ What is a Database?

A **database** is a structured system for storing and retrieving data efficiently. In this project, we use a **relational database**, which organizes data into tables with defined relationshipsâ€”ideal for structured records like student data, transactions, or user profiles.

### ðŸ”¹ What is Amazon RDS?

**Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)** is a fully managed service that simplifies database setup, operation, and scaling. It automates tasks like backups, patching, and replication, allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than infrastructure.

## Step 1: Create a RDS Database

1. Go to AWS Console â†’ Go to Aurora and RDS Services 
2. Click on the Database Tab â†’ Click to Create Database   
    - Choose a database creation method â†’ Standard create
    - Engine options (Engine type)â†’ **MariaDB** (version - MariaDB 11.4.5)
    - **Templates â†’ Free tier**
    - DB instance identifier â†’ rds-db
    - Credentials Settings
        - Master username â†’ admin
        - Check-in â†’ **Auto generate password**
    - InstanceÂ â†’db.t4g.micro
    - Storage Setting
        - Storage type â†’ General Purpose SSD (gp2)
        - Allocated storage â†’ 20GB (default)
        - Check-in â†’ Enable storage autoscaling
        - Maximum storage threshold â†’ 1000GB (default)
    - Connectivity
    - Virtual private cloud (VPC) â†’ Default
    - DB subnet group â†’ Default
    - Public access â†’ No
    - Existing VPC security groups â†’ launch-wizard-1 (mysql-3306)
    - Availability Zone â†’ Any one (Optional)
    - Database authentication â†’ Password authentication
    - Additional configuration
        - Initial database name â†’ <write db name directed created by rds>
    - Create Database

3. Now RDS Database is Created 
4. copy password & endpoint 

```sql
#password 
82WiUYfP9gbZh4ccTHmc
#endpoint 
rds-db.c8taowgcq72q.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
```

## Step 2: Create a demo instance

1. Go to AWS Console â†’ EC2 services 
2. Click on the Launch Instance 
    - name â†’ demo
    - AMI â†’ Amazon Linux
    - Instance type â†’ t2.micro
    - Key pair â†’ pem-server-key
    - security group â†’ launch-wizard-1
    - Click on launch instance

3. Connect via SSH 

```bash
ssh -i "pem-server-key.pem" ec2-user@ec2-54-224-4-147.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

![Project Screenshot](/images/connected.png)

4. update system and install MariaDB server

```bash
sudo yum update
sudo yum install -y mariadb105
sudo systemctl start mariadb
sudo systemctl enable mariadb
```

![Project Screenshot](/images/install-start.png)

5. connect the RDS database 

```bash
# enpoint -> Copy from RDS ->>> rds-db.c8taowgcq72q.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com 
mysql -h rds-db.c8taowgcq72q.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u admin -p
# enter password auto gentreted 
82WiUYfP9gbZh4ccTHmc
```

6. Now you inside the RDS 

```sql
show databses;
exit;
```

## Step 4: Delete RDS & instance

1. Go to RDS Console 
2. Select RDS which you want to delete 
3. Click on Action â†’ Delete 
4. uncheck the box - snapshotDetermines & backupsDetermines
5. then Check-in the acknowledge
6. type delete me then Click Delete

7. Go to EC2 service then Click on instance 
8. Select instance that you want to delete 
9. Click on Instance state â†’ Terminate the instance
